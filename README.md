Data visualization - data cleaning - preprocessing - dashboard via Plotly's dash

Study about LA's crime per area, hour, time, day, month etc... from 2020 until today,

We are updating the file via the preprocessing.py file where we dl the updated file from data.lacity.org:

data description & file link can be found at :https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8

Find my preprocess.py file with the data cleaning, reformatting and analysis of what to keep, add or remove from the dataset.

The app.py file is about the set up of the dash web app and the interactive callbacks to analyze by year/month/ hours & area.

I put a range slider regarding time to choose , a multi-option dropdown to select area.

I meanly used plotly.express to show graphs.
